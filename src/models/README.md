# Models

This directory contains data models, interfaces, and type definitions.

Models are responsible for:
- Defining data structures and interfaces
- Type definitions for entities
- Data transfer objects (DTOs)
- Custom types for domain models

Note: Database models are defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`
