# Routes

This directory contains route definitions for the API endpoints.

Routes are responsible for:
- Defining API endpoint paths
- Mapping HTTP methods to controller functions
- Applying middleware (authentication, validation, etc.)
- Organizing related endpoints

Example: `auth.routes.ts`, `product.routes.ts`, `order.routes.ts`
